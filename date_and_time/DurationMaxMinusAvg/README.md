# The difference between Duration units
## Description
Find the `Duration` units' average and subtract it from the max `Duration` unit using the `minus()` method.
Note that you need to implement the `getMaxMinusAvg()` method to return the result of the subtraction but this doesn't mean that all logic must be there. You can have more methods.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
2
3
35
300
300
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
PT36H40M
```
