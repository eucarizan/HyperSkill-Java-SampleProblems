# Implementing vehicle hierarchy with wheels
## Description
Create a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles. The base class should have a protected instance variable for the number of wheels. Derive classes for bicycle, motorcycle, and car from the base class. Each derived class should have a method to print the number of wheels for that vehicle type.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
bicycle
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
A bicycle has 2 wheels.
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```console
motorcycle
```

**Sample Output 2:**
```console
A motorcycle has 2 wheels.
```
