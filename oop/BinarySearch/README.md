# Binary search
## Description
The class `Arrays` includes a lot of useful methods for processing arrays. One of them is the `binarySearch` method. It allows you to quickly find the index of an element in the given ordered array. You just need to pass the array of values and the value to search for to this method.

In this quiz, you need to call this method from the `Arrays` class without using an import statement.

Do not use your own implementation of the searching method, it may not work with prepared tests.
