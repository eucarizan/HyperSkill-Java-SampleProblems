# Shapes area

## Description
You have five classes: `Shape`, `Triangle`, `Circle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle`. The class Shape has a method `area()`. This method does nothing. Override the method in all subclasses. Overridden methods should return an area of a particular figure. Use class fields for this.

- The area of a triangle is **_S = bh/2_** where **_h_** is the height of the triangle, **_b_** is the base of the triangle.
- The area of a circle is **_S = &pi;R<sup>2</sup>_** where **_R_** is the radius of the circle. For **_&pi;_** use the `Math.PI` constant.
- The area of a square is **_S = s<sup>2</sup>_** where **_s_** is the length of the side of the square.
- The area o a rectangle is **_S = wh_** where **_w_** is the width of the rectangle and **_h_** the height of the rectangle.
