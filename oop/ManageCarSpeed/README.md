# Managing speed in a car class
## Description
You are to write a Java program that defines a 'Car' class with a private field 'speed', which is an integer. The class should also have a public method 'drive' that takes an integer as input and adds it to the 'speed'. If the end result is greater than 200, the program should cap the speed at 200. Finally, the program should have another public method 'displaySpeed' that prints the current speed value. The input defines how fast you want to drive your car. Your program should output the car speed after driving.


## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
100

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
100
```

**Sample Input 2:**
