# Saying animals

## Description
You have four classes: `Animal`, `Cat`, `Dog`, and `Duck`. The class animal has a method `say()`.

Override the method in all subclasses. Overridden methods should output what these animals say (using `System.out.println`).

Cat:
```
meow-meow
```

Dog:
```
arf-arf
```

Duck:
```
quack-quack
```
