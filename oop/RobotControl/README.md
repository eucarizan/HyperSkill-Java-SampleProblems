# Title
## Description
There is a robot in the game field. The position of the robot in this field is described by two integer coordinates: X and Y. The _X axis_ is oriented from left to right, the _Y axis_ â€” from bottom to top.

At the initial moment, the robot is located at some coordinate on the field. It's also known where the robot looks: up, down, to the right or to the left. The initial position of the robot and its direction can have **any values**. <ins>You need to bring the robot to the destination point of the game field.<ins>

A robot is described by the `Robot` class. You can use the following methods of this class (with unknown implementation):

```java
public class Robot {

    public Direction getDirection() {
        // current direction
    }

    public int getX() {
        // current X coordinate
    }

    public int getY() {
        // current Y coordinate
    }

    public void turnLeft() {
        // rotate the robot 90 degrees counterclockwise
    }

    public void turnRight() {
        // rotate the robot 90 degrees clockwise
    }

    public void stepForward() {
        // take one step in the current direction
        // x or y coordinate will be changed by 1
    }
}
```

The direction of the robot is an enumeration:

```java
public enum Direction {
    UP,
    DOWN,
    LEFT,
    RIGHT
}
```

**Example**

- The following values are passed to the moveRobot method: toX == 3, toY == 0.
- The initial state of this robot: robot.getX() == 0, robot.getY() == 0, robot.getDirection() == Direction.UP.

To bring the robot to the destination point (3, 0), the method should call the following methods:
```java
robot.turnRight();
robot.stepForward();
robot.stepForward();
robot.stepForward();
```

**Another Example**

- The following target values are passed to the moveRobot method: toX == 0, toY == -1.
- The initial state of this robot: robot.getX() == 1, robot.getY() == 1, robot.getDirection() == Direction.RIGHT.

To bring the robot to the destination point (0, -1), the method should call the following methods:
```java
robot.turnRight();
robot.turnRight();
robot.stepForward();
robot.turnLeft();
robot.stepForward();
robot.stepForward();
```

**Tip**: Pay attention to the loops: sometimes they tend to become infinite...
