# Test learners

## Description
We need your help to improve an adaptive system. There's a program that asks learners what programming language they are learning. There are four options, one of them is correct:

1. **Java**
2. Kotlin
3. Scala
4. Python

Your task: read the answerâ€™s number from the standard input and output the result of the test: **"Yes!"**, **"No!"** or **"Unknown number"**. We hope you know which answer is correct. You don't need to print the question itself.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
1
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
Yes!
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```console
6
```

**Sample Output 2:**
```console
Unknown number
```
