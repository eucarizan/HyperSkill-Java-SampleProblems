# Leap year

## Description
Find whether a given year is a leap year.

Just a reminder: a leap year is divisible by 4 AND NOT divisible by 100 OR divisible by 400 (for example, the year 2000 is a leap year, but the year 2100 will not be a leap year).

The program should work correctly for the years 1900 ≤ n ≤ 3000.

Output "Leap" (case-sensitive) if the given year is a leap year, and "Regular" otherwise.

It is enough to write a simple conditional statement to solve this task.

## Examples
```

**Sample Input 1:**
```console
2100
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
Regular
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```console
2000
```

**Sample Output 2:**
```console
Leap
```
