# The count of numbers divisible by N

## Description
Write a program that reads three positive integers **a**, **b**, **n** and outputs the count of numbers divisible by **n** in the range from a to b (a < b) inclusively.

**Note**: it is possible to write this program more efficiently without any loops.

## Examples
