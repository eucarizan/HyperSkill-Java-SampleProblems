# Shape

## Description
Write a program, which reads the number of the shape (1 – square, 2 – circle, 3 – triangle, 4 – rhombus) and prints the text "**You have chosen a square**" (or circle, or triangle, or rhombus, depending on the number). If it is a number that doesn't correspond to any of the listed shapes, the program should output: "**There is no such shape!**".

Note: the output text should **exactly** match the sample, including letters' case and location of spaces.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
1
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
You have chosen a square
```
