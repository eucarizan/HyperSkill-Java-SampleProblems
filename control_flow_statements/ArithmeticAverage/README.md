# Arithmetic average

## Description
Write a program that reads two numbers **_a_** and **_b_** from the keyboard and calculates and outputs to the console the arithmetic average of all numbers from the interval [**_a_**;**_b_**], which are divisible by **3**.

In the example below, the arithmetic average is calculated for the numbers on the interval [**_-5_**; **_12_**]. On this interval, there are **6** numbers divisible by **3**, namely: **-3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12**. Their arithmetic average equals **4.5**.

The program input contains intervals, which always contain at least one number, which is divisible by **3**.

Remember that the int type cannot contain fractions. Use a double variable to store the precise result of the division.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
-5
12
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
4.5
```
