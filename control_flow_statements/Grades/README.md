# Grades

## Description
Find the number of D, C, B and A grades for the last test on informatics, where **n** students from a class have successfully passed the test.

The program gets number **n** as the first line of input and then gets the grades themselves, each on a new line.

The program must output four numbers in a single line: the number of D, C, B, and A grades (in that order), separated by blank space characters.

## Examples

```console
