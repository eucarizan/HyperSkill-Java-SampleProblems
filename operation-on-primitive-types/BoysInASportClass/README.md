# Boys in a sport class

## Description
Suppose there are three boys in a sports class.

You need to write a program that checks if the boys are arranged in ascending or descending order by height. The program must read three integer numbers `h1`, `h2`, `h3` and outputs `true` or `false`. If boys have the same height, they are considered as correctly arranged.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
165 161 158
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
true
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```console
155 165 160
```

**Sample Output 2:**
```console
false
```

**Sample Input 3:**
```console
161 161 165
```

**Sample Output 3:**

```
