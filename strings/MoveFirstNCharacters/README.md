# Move the first N characters

## Description
Write a program that reads a string **s** and an int **n**, and then moves the first **n** characters of **s** to the end of the string. The program must output the changed string. If **n** is greater than the length of the string, it must output the string unchanged.

Note, the substring method can help you, but you may choose another way to solve the problem.

**Input data format**
The single input line contains **s** and **n** separated by a space.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
Hello 3
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
loHel
```
