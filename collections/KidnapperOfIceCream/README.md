# Kidnapper of Ice cream

## Description
Imagine now you are an outlaw in the Sherlock Holmes times. You are in need of money and you want to demand some by blackmailing. Obviously, you have to write a letter completely anonymously because you do not want to be busted.

So you decide to compose a letter by cutting the required words from a newspaper.

In this problem, you get two lines: 1) available words you have in a newspaper, 2) your note.

Find out and print if you can write a note from available words ("**You get money**") or you will be busted ("**You are busted**").

**Remember**: your note is case-sensitive

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
batman batman batman i i I need am and and money
I am batman and i need money
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
You get money
```
