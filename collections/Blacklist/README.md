# Blacklist
## Description
Has it ever bothered you when unknown people call you and try to impose their services? That can be annoying.

Let's try to solve the problem by using a blacklist. You should implement the `filterPhones` method that returns only the phone numbers that are not on the blacklist.

**Tip:** Choose appropriate method(s) of the Collection interface to solve this task.


## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
387-968-2999 505-468-5235 739-738-3272
505-468-5235
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
387-968-2999 739-738-3272
```
